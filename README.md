Absenteeism refers to the habitual non-presence of an employee at his or her job. Possible causes of over-absenteeism include job dissatisfaction, ongoing personal issues, and chronic medical problems. Regardless of the root cause, a worker who exhibits a long-term pattern of being absent may tarnish his reputation, which may consequently threaten his long-term employability.
