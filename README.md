## DEFINE

Absenteeism refers to the habitual non-presence of an employee at his or her job. Possible causes of over-absenteeism include job dissatisfaction, ongoing personal issues, and chronic medical problems. Regardless of the root cause, a worker who exhibits a long-term pattern of being absent may tarnish his reputation, which may consequently threaten his long-term employability. However, some forms of absence from work are legally protected and cannot be grounds for termination. The reasons for absenteeism are analyzed and a machine learning model is created to know what all factors majorly contribute to Absenteeism in workplace.
